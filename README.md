Jasmine Version 2 – A New Era of Intelligent Market Awareness
(Updated UI, Enhanced Functionality, Smarter Insights)

Following the success of Version 1.1—originally migrated from VS Code—we’re proud to announce the release of Jasmine Version 2, marking a major leap forward in both user experience and capability. This release builds upon the solid foundation of Jasmine's core vision: to serve as your intelligent virtual browser agent, offering real-time market awareness as you explore the internet.

What is Jasmine?
Jasmine is not just another browser assistant. It's a purpose-built companion designed specifically for traders, investors, and market enthusiasts. Jasmine integrates seamlessly into your browsing experience, delivering relevant financial data, crypto and stock alerts, sentiment signals, and curated news feeds—all without interrupting your flow.

What’s New in Version 2?

Completely Revamped User Interface
A sleeker, cleaner, and more responsive UI makes interacting with Jasmine faster, more intuitive, and more aesthetically aligned with modern trading dashboards.

Smarter Context Awareness
Jasmine now interprets the content you’re reading in real time, surfacing market indicators, ticker mentions, and sector-specific insights as you browse.

Expanded Market Coverage
In addition to traditional equities and major crypto tokens, Jasmine now supports altcoins, DeFi projects, forex pairs, and trending market narratives.

Modular Notification System
Users can now customize alert types—such as price spikes, social volume surges, or regulatory news—to suit their unique trading style and risk tolerance.

Performance Optimizations & Backend Upgrades
With improvements to speed and memory handling, Jasmine runs more smoothly across devices and adapts better to heavier data environments.

Looking Ahead
Version 2 is just the beginning. Jasmine will continue to evolve through frequent over-the-air updates, including deeper AI integrations, portfolio tracking modules, trade simulation support, and compatibility with on-chain data feeds.

Your Edge, Wherever You Browse.
Whether you're reading news, researching a project, or idly scrolling forums, Jasmine is there—quietly processing, alerting, and guiding your decisions with actionable insights.

Stay tuned for more updates as we push toward making Jasmine the gold standard in intelligent, trader-focused browser agents.
